    <p>
      Yeah, Red is really my name. I'm the Head of (Software) Development at Mindfire, and I code. Currently I really
      like Typescript, Go and Dart. But I have experience in a lot of other languages and technologies. I already did a
      lot in my live, from being a banker, to work as music composer, to being a freelance web developer, and designing
      t-shirts.

        <strong>Î»</strong> I prefer FP over OOP, but whatever gets the job done.
