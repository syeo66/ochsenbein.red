If you are a Software Engineer, or involved in any kind of software development you probably heard something about "Agile".
Also you probably noticed there are about as many opinions what "Agile" is as there are people, and some more.

In this article I'll argue that the agile process is in fact (or at least should be) the same as the scientific process.

## The scientific process

The scientific process in its basic form is pretty simple and includes the following steps:

- Formulate a hypothesis
- Design an experiment
- Build the experiment
- Perform the experiment
- Gather the data
- Analyze the data and draw conclusions
- Rinse and repeat

Of course there might be substeps. For instance to formulate a proper hypothesis you'd have to start with a question and do some preliminary research. But we are looking at the main idea of the process here.

## The agile process

The agile process looks quite similar:

- Define iterations (also called sprint) goal
- Write the stories, requirements and acceptance criteria
- Develop the defined features
- Deploy the feature
- Gather data and feedback
- Analyze the data and draw conclusions
- Rinse and repeat

I think you start to see the similarities. Let's take a look at the steps of the scientific process and see how they translate to the agile process.

### Formulate a hypothesis

Formulating an hypothesis means you start with a question, gather existing information and research, and come up with an idea you want to test. The same should be true for the iterations goal: See where you stand in the project, retrieve information about the stakeholders needs, and define a goal.

### Design an experiment

Designing an experiment means you take your hypothesis and think about the consequences of it, if it were true. What testable predictions can you make? How can you test it? What do you need to build and how can you make sure you are really testing your hypothesis and not something else? This is one of hardest part of the scientific process. To get an experiment right is notoriously hard and you have to be very specific and precise. Not only do you need to build the experiment itself but you also need to know what data you might need to collect and how to collect it.

This is pretty similar to definining the requirements of a feature (story, task, or whatever you want to call it). It is very important to exactly know what you want to achieve, and be specific and precise. You have to define acceptance critaria. At the end of this you should know exactly what the feature does, and how to measure if tje feature is successful (in contrast to 'it is just working').

### Build the experiment

Building an experiment can be as simple as printing some questionairs or as hard as having to build a machine like the LHC at CERN. The most important thing is to know what you are building based on the experiments design.

The also the step where the software actually gets built. Based on the specifications and acceptance criteria your team builds the features. Similar to the science experiment this can be as simple as adding a button or as complex as implementing a new ML/AI algorithm.

### Run the experiment

This step does not need many words. Conduct the experiment and make sure you receive all the data you defined in the design.

The same is true in the agile process: Deploy it and make sure you recieve the feedback and data you need to measure the impact and success of the feature.

### Gather the data

### Analyze the data and draw conclusions

### Rinse and repeat

## What steps are skipped quite often?
