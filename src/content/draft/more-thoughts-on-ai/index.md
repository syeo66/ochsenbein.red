I recently wrote an article with my thoughts on the state of AI. Little did I know about the flurry of developments we would face in only a few days. We are now at a point where high profile people are asking to pause and think. And I am sure we should pause and think. Does this mean we should stop the development? It's not even a question: The cat is out of the bag - there is no stopping now. What we should do is increase the efforts in the fields of AI safety, ethics, social development, and the definition of human work... by a lot.

There were more than enough examples in the past where those voices asking for more consideration were silenced in the name of profit. We can't do that anymore. The price is simply to high. Do I have the answers? No, nobody has. We just don't know what we are and will be dealing with.

Anyways, here are some thoughts keeping my brain busy lately.

## Noise-to-signal ratio

## Killing creativity and knowledge

## To AGI or not to AGI

### Human level AI

### Non-human AGI
