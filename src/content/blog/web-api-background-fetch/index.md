description: 'First time playing around with the Background Fetch API'

So, I wanted to launch a blog. But first I needed to find out what to write about, and to be honest, I really struggle with this because I’m indeed suffering from the impostor syndrome. Despite working in the web development industry for more than 20 years now. Despite having won several awards, realized an almost endless number of projects, having mentored lots of junior developers in my role as a senior, despite all of that I still feel like not being adequate enough to write about development stuff and try to tell you about my perspective and how I do things.

What should I do then? One thing I undoubtedly know is this: I might not feel like being a developer adequate enough to tell you things. But I am indeed good at learning and figuring stuff out. Therefore, I went to a list of all the available Web APIs in the browsers and thought of all the things I never used. What if I just try finding something to do with every API on that list? Just one small thing for each of the Web APIs and document it here? Let’s merely do that. Seems to be interesting enough. You and I might discover new things in the process and maybe I can even help someone with my discoveries. So, the Web APIs series is born and I’d like kicking it off with the Background Fetch API.

## What is Background Fetch?

Background fetch is essentially a mechanism to defer requests when the user is offline. It can be utilized to retrieve data needing a long time to download and handles it if the user goes offline in the meantime. Additionally it does continue to download even if the user navigates to another page or site.
